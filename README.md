# BlogInPy
The smallest static blog generator ever !

If you want a blog, if you doesn't have money or server to run Wordpress, if you don't want to use big engine like Jekill : Use BlogInPy !
BlogInPy is so small ! Just a very little config file, a basic HTML template, a small css stylesheet and a Python app... Just nothing.

Now you can generate blogs in only one minute ! Create article in Markdown (with some Z-Markdown functionnality !) with images, videos,
tables, link and text !

SO EASY !
